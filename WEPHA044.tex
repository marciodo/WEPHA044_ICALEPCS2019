\title{Upgrade of the Bunch Length and Bunch Charge Control Systems for the New SLAC Free Electron Laser}

\begin{abstract}
In 2019 SLAC is building a new linear accelerator based on superconducting niobium cavities. The first one, now called the copper linac, could generate 120 electron bunches per second. The new one, called superconducting linac, will generate 1 million per second, bringing some challenges to many devices along with the accelerator. Most of them receive sensors and actuators in a VME-based Platform with its control running in software, with RTEMS as OS. This is feasible for 120 Hz, but not for 1 MHz. The new control hardware is ATCA-based Platform, that has carrier boards with FPGA connected to servers running Embedded real-time Linux OS, forming the High-Performance System (HPS). Instead of having all the new architecture installed at the accelerator and tested on the go, SLAC used the strategy of testing the systems in the copper linac, to have them ready to use in the superconducting linac in what was called the Mission Readiness Program. The Bunch Length System and the Bunch Charge System are examples of devices of this program. Both systems were tested in the copper linac at 120 Hz, with excellent results. The next step is to test them at the superconducting linac, at 1 MHz.

\section{Introduction}
LCLS has two bunch length monitors based on pyro detectors\cite{blen-pac07} and xxx bunch charge monitors based on Toroids, the two types of devices that were in the scope of this upgrade. Beyond these devices, LCLS uses gap diode to measure the bunch length\cite{injector-commissioning-2007} and Faraday cup and BPMs to measure the bunch charge [reference].

\subsection{Pyro Detector Bunch Length Structure}
LCLS has two bunch compressors (BC). A hole mirror is placed after the last bending magnet of each BC, generating diffraction radiation (DR) from the edge radiation (ER) (see Fig. \ref{fig:blen_struct1}). The DR is, then, reflected, split, and filtered before getting to two pyro detectors (see Fig. \ref{fig:blen_struct2}). \cite{blen-pac07}

By using specific optical filters it is possible to measure difference in the intensity of the signals at the pyro detector output for different lengths of the bunch. Comparing signal intensity for different bunches it is possible to know that one bunch is larger or shorter relative to the other. Calculating the absolute length is only possible when the charge of the beam is used for normalization. [reference]

   \label{fig:blen_struct2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Toroid Bunch Charge Structure}
A toroid is placed at the accelerator in a way that the electron beam passes through its hole, inducting a current in the turns. This current is conditioned as it can have enough width for the temporal resolution of the digitizer. The digitized signal is integrated resulting in the bunch charge. [reference]

[figure showing structure]

\section{Bunch Length System}
The signal of the pyro detectors is digitalized, processed by an equation that results in the length of the bunch, and timestamped to log a correspondence between the result and the electron bunch among all the accelerator systems. In the next two sections we will show the architecture of the previous VME-based system and how it was upgraded to an ATCA-based architecture.

\subsection{VME-based architecture}
Figure \ref{fig:blen_vme} shows the high-level process of the original bunch length system.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \centering
   \includegraphics*[width=\columnwidth]{BLEN_VME_Process}
   \caption{The original (before the upgrade) bunch length system process.}
   \label{fig:blen_vme}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item The timing system sends a packet containing the timing pattern with event codes and the timestamp. The EVR in the VME crate receives this data. The IOC running in VME waits for a specific event code. When it arrives, the timestamp is registered.
   \item Using the IP 445 module, the IOC running in VME sends a trigger to the digitizer, telling it to start collecting data from the pyro detector.
   \item The IOC running in the VME tells to the IOC running in the Digitizer that it is waiting for data as soon as the Digitizer finishes its digitalization. The VME IOC also sends a timestamp that will be used by the Digitizer IOC as a data label.
   \item When the digitalization is complete, the Digitizer IOC sends an UDPComm packet to the VME IOC with the digitized data containing one raw waveform per each of the pyro detectors. The data is labeled with the timestamp previously sent by the VME IOC. 
   \item Parallel to the communication with the Digitizer IOC, the VME IOC receives the charge of the bunch (TMIT) sent by the BPM system, through an FCOM packet.
   \item The VME IOC confirms the timestamp from the EVR, the Digitizer, and the BPM system and, if they match, it calculates the bunch length.
   \item The result of the calculation is recorded in the many EPICS records that are part of the BSA system.
   \item The VME IOC sends an FCOM package to the Fast Feedback System, containing the calculated bunch length.
\end{enumerate}
